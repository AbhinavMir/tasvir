# tasveer

**Notice:** This project is still under maintainence, I would love your support as I have to dedicate time to a few other projects as of now. The final project will be beautifully integrated into the Python ecosystem with perfect OOPs, Clean Code and the Zen of Python .â˜º

A Python Package to help you quickly download a few images for testing/validation purposes. It help you to download tons of images!

## Installation

Use the python package manager (pip) to install.

```bash
pip install tasveer
```

## Usage

```python
from tasveer import download
download()
```

Output:

```bash
Enter query: cat
Enter limit count images: 2
Downloading images for: cat ...
Saved at:
downloads/cat/1.grumpy-cat.jpg
downloads/cat/2.1339479807_1GG.jpg
```

## Local develop

```bash
pip install ".[dev]"
```

Lint and auto pep8:

```bash
pyint .
autopep8 -i tasveer
```

Once you are done, you will get a prompt to enter queries and number of downloads to do. After you enter, your downloads will be saved in your current directory under downloads/query_entered.

## Future Work

Feel free to pull. Here's what I plan to work on-

1. Include a lightweight cleaning and processing function

2. Change from prompt to argument
